# EnvironmentMonitoringDevice
This project is an IoT-based environment monitoring system that leverages the ESP32 microcontroller, DHT11 sensor, and AWS IoT to monitor and analyze temperature and humidity data in real time. The system enables secure data transmission and remote monitoring through the AWS cloud platform, making it ideal for applications like greenhouse monitoring, weather stations, or smart homes.

Features
    Accurate Environmental Data: Monitors temperature and humidity with the DHT11 sensor.
    Cloud Integration: Transmits data to AWS IoT for storage, visualization, and further processing.
    Secure Communication: Ensures data integrity and confidentiality using TLS encryption.
    Remote Monitoring: Access real-time and historical data from anywhere via the AWS dashboard.
    Scalable Architecture: Easily extendable to include additional sensors or devices.
